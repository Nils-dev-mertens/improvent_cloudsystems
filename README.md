# I got tired of bad documentation, so I tried to fix it as a community.

This website is made out of pure frustration to share and publish well-documented knowledge about one subject. This is not out of hatred or something but just pure boredom/frustration.

It's an easy website for .md files that are translated to HTML pages for the viewers. This is, I hope, a big step in the right direction for an easy learning way for me and others.

If I ever start on the new version of this project, it's probably going to be more focused on the social aspect of learning. Think about a chat function per file or something around that.

happy studying.
